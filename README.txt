	Pyle Sheets (or PCSS as you'll often see both names) is an opportunity for everyone to 
enjoy more opportunities to use Python while engaged in web development. Pyle Sheets is a 
competitor with LESS, SASS and other modifications of Cascading Style Sheets that offer
more options such as variables that gives a more programatic and functional feel to 
everyone's favorite Style Sheet.
	
	PCSS compiles to CSS via Python. Currently, it can act "in memory" so you can
simply tinker with it, albeit debugging support needs to be added when not actively
compiling and simply runing a Pyle Sheet in memory. PCSS is intended to be used with other
modules such as Flask in particular, but modules such as Django are great enough that some 
would say it is better than Flask and to top it all off, you have even more options such as
raw Jinja2, Werkzeug (Individual predecessor components of Flask), & various WSGI's. 

	If you have any suggestions or want to tweak this project, feel free!
